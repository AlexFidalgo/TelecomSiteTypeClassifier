# Telecom Site Type Classifier

![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

A machine learning project that predicts telecom site types such as rooftops, greenfields, and more.

## Overview

The Telecom Site Type Classifier project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the type of telecom sites, including rooftops, greenfields, and others. The goal is to automate the site type classification process based on relevant features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/AlexFidalgo/TelecomSiteTypeClassifier.git
   cd TelecomSiteTypeClassifier
   

2. Download the dataset from Anatel's website [Anatel](https://sistemas.anatel.gov.br/se/public/view/b/licenciamento.php) and place it in the data/ directory.

3. Install the necessary dependencies (Python and required libraries).

4. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
